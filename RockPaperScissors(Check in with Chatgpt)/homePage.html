<!--
    Add Confirmation For Play Again; When the user clicks 
    the "Play Again" button, it's a good idea to provide a confirmation prompt
    to make sure they intend to restart the game. 
    This can prevent accidental restarts.

    Add Online Multiplayer;  If you're interested in more advanced web development, 
    you could implement an online multiplayer version of the game 
    that allows users to play against each other in real-time.

    Add Game Stats; 
    Keep track of additional statistics, such as the percentage of wins, 
    losses, ties, etc. Display these stats at the end of each game 
    or in a separate stats section.

    Add Customizable UI;  Allow users to customize the look 
    and feel of the game by choosing different themes or styles.
